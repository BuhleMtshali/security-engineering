# 🐍 Python & SQL Core

## Automation, Analytics & Leverage 🧠⚙️

### Welcome to the Python & SQL core of my Security Data Engineering roadmap.

- This domain is where raw data becomes signal.

- Before dashboards. Before detections.

- There is parsing, transforming, querying, and reasoning.

```
Security at scale is impossible without automation.
So we automate 😌

```

## 🎯 What This Section Covers

- 🐍 Python fundamentals & scripting

- 📄 Log parsing and data cleaning

- ⚙️ Automation for security workflows

- 🧮 SQL querying, aggregation, joins

- 📊 Analytics for security datasets

- 🧠 Writing reusable, readable tools


## 🧰 Why This Matters for Security & Data

- Modern security is a data problem.

    - Logs are noisy

    - Alerts are repetitive

    - Humans don’t scale

- Python + SQL = working smarter, not louder.
