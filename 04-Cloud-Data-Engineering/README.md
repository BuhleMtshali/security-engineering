# ☁️ Cloud & Data Engineering Foundations

## Where Modern Security Lives ☁️📊

### Welcome to the Cloud & Data Engineering section of my roadmap.

- This domain focuses on how security data is generated, moved, and stored in the cloud.

- Before dashboards. Before SOC alerts.

- There is architecture, identity, and pipelines.

```
If you don’t understand the cloud,

you don’t understand modern security.

```

## 🎯 What This Section Covers

- ☁️ Cloud fundamentals (AWS/GCP concepts)

- 🔐 Identity & Access Management (IAM)

- 📜 Cloud logging (CloudTrail, flow logs, audit logs)

- 🔄 Data pipelines & storage

- ⚡ Batch vs streaming concepts

- 💸 Cost-aware and secure architecture


## 🧰 Why This Matters for Security & Data

- Security data is born in the cloud.

    - Logs originate here

    - Permissions break here

    - Detections scale here

    - Costs spiral here

- Understanding this layer lets you build real systems.

## 📁 What You’ll Find in This Folder

```
📁 04-cloud-data-engineering/
├── cloud-logging/
├── iam-security/
├── data-pipelines/
├── detection-ready-architecture/
└── README.md

```

- Each subfolder contains:

    - Configs or scripts

    - Sample logs

    - Architecture explanation


## 🧠 Skills Gained Here

- Comfort in cloud-native environments

- Understanding of log pipelines end-to-end

- Ability to design detection-ready systems

- Data engineering crossover confidence


## 🔜 What Comes After

- This foundation feeds directly into:

    - SIEM ingestion

    - Detection engineering

    - Cloud security roles

- Cloud is not optional anymore ☁️✨
