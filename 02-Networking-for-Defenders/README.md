# 🌐 Networking for Defenders & Data People

## Seeing the Wires Behind the Web 🕸️📡

### Welcome to the Networking section of my Security Data Engineering roadmap.

- This domain focuses on how data moves, connects, and fails across systems.

- Before alerts. Before dashboards. Before investigations.

- There is traffic, packets, protocols, and paths.

```

If you don’t understand how data flows,

you can’t tell normal from malicious.

We don’t guess here either 😤

```

## 🎯 What This Section Covers

1. 🌍 TCP/IP, UDP, DNS, HTTP/S fundamentals

2. 🔢 IP addressing, subnetting, routing basics

3. 🔥 Firewalls, NAT, VPNs, proxies

4. 📡 Network logs & flow data

5. 🕵🏾 Traffic analysis & anomaly detection

6. 🚨 Common attack patterns (scans, beaconing, exfiltration)


## 🧰 Why This Matters for Security & Data

- Every breach travels over a network.

    - C2 traffic hides here

    - Data exfiltration happens here

    - Lateral movement lives here

    - Cloud traffic explodes here

- Networking knowledge turns alerts into answers.


## 📁 What You’ll Find in This Folder

```
📁 02-networking-for-defenders/
├── protocol-basics/
├── traffic-analysis-labs/
├── attack-scenarios/
├── flow-log-analysis/
└── README.md

```

### - Each subfolder contains:

    - Packet captures or logs

    - Analysis scripts or notes

    - A README explaining what I investigated and why


## 🧠 Skills Gained Here

- Ability to reason about traffic behavior

- Confidence analyzing suspicious connections

- Strong intuition for detection logic

- Foundation for SIEM and cloud networking

## 🔜 What Comes After

- This knowledge feeds directly into:

    - Python log parsing

    - Cloud flow logs

    - SIEM detections

    - Threat hunting

- You can’t defend what you can’t trace 🧭✨
