# 🚀 Security Data Engineering Journey

## From Fundamentals → Detection → Mastery 🔐📊

### Welcome to my Security Data Engineering Roadmap Repository 🧭

This repo is my living logbook of hands-on projects, built day by day as I train to become a Security Data Engineer / Security Operations Engineer with a strong data + cloud focus.

- This is not tutorial code.

- This is proof of work.

- Receipts only 🧾🔥

## 🧠 What This Repo Is

- A structured, end-to-end learning journey

- A collection of realistic security + data artifacts

- A portfolio designed to answer one question:

```
“Can this person do the job?”

```

- Each folder represents a domain, each subfolder a project, and each project includes a README explaining what, why, and how.


## 🧩 Learning Domains Covered

This repo is organized by core competency areas required for modern defenders and security data engineers:

1. 🖥️ IT & Linux Foundations

2. 🌐 Networking (for Defenders & Data People)

3. 🐍 Python & SQL (Automation + Analytics Core)

4. ☁️ Cloud & Data Engineering Foundations

5. 🛡️ SOC, SIEM & Detection Engineering

6. 🧠 Mastery, Portfolio & Interview Readiness

### Each domain has:

- Its own README explaining scope and goals

- Multiple project folders

- Clear progression from basics → applied → advanced

- Clean. Predictable. Recruiter-friendly 😮‍💨✨


## 🧾 What a “Project” Means Here

- Every project includes:

    - ✅ Source code / configs

    - ✅ Sample data or logs

    - ✅ Visuals (dashboards, diagrams, screenshots)

    - ✅ A README explaining decisions

- Think: mini job simulations, not exercises.


## 🏁 End Goal

- By the end of this roadmap, I aim to:

    - 🔐 Build and analyze security detections using real data

    - 📊 Design pipelines that move, clean, and analyze logs at scale

    - ☁️ Work confidently in cloud-native security environments

    - 🧠 Speak fluently about security trade-offs in interviews

    - 📁 Present a portfolio that speaks louder than a CV

This repo grows daily.
Each commit is momentum 🧱🔥
