# 🖥️ IT & Linux Foundations

## The Bedrock of Every Security Engineer 🧱🐧

### Welcome to the IT & Linux Foundations section of my Security Data Engineering roadmap.

- This domain focuses on how computers actually work beneath the abstractions.

- Before cloud. Before SIEMs. Before detections.

- There is Linux, processes, files, users, and permissions.

```

If you don’t understand this layer, security becomes guesswork.
We don’t guess here 😤

```

## 🎯 What This Section Covers

- 🧠 Core IT concepts (OS, processes, memory, storage)

- 🐧 Linux navigation and command-line fluency

- 👤 Users, groups, permissions, and access control

- 📁 Filesystems, logs, and system structure

- ⚙️ Processes, services, and scheduling

- 🔍 Troubleshooting like a real admin


## 🧰 Why This Matters for Security & Data

- Everything you defend runs on an OS.

    - Logs live here

    - Malware hides here

    - Permissions break here

    - Data pipelines fail here

- Mastering Linux = seeing the system clearly 👀

## 📁 What You’ll Find in This Folder

```
📁 01-it-linux-foundations/
├── day-01-linux-cli-basics/
├── day-02-files-permissions/
├── day-03-processes-services/
├── day-04-logs-analysis/
├── day-05-bash-automation/
└── README.md

```

- Each subfolder contains:

    - Project files

    - Sample outputs

    - A README explaining what I built and why


## 🧠 Skills Gained Here

- Comfort in any terminal 😎

- Ability to read and understand system logs

- Confidence troubleshooting unfamiliar systems

- Foundation for SOC, cloud, and detection work


## 🔜 What Comes After

- This foundation feeds directly into:

    - Networking analysis

    - Cloud environments

    - SIEM log ingestion

    - Detection engineering

- No shortcuts. Just solid ground 🧱✨
