# 🌐 Day 6 – Network Snapshot Report (Linux Foundations)

## Welcome to Day 6 of my Security Engineering journey 🚀

- Today’s mission: act like a tiny network detective 🕵🏽‍♀️ and take a snapshot of my system’s network state using core Linux networking tools.

- Think of this as a “health check” for how my machine talks to the internet.
