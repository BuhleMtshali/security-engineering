## IT & Linux Foundations – Security Data Engineering Roadmap 🧱🐧

### Welcome to Day 1 of my Security Data Engineering journey 🚀

Today was all about building mental models. Before touching Linux commands, cloud dashboards, or SIEM alerts, I focused on understanding what’s really happening under the hood when a computer runs a program.

- This day answers one question:

“What is a computer actually doing when I click Run?📟”

```

Spoiler: it’s not magic. It’s electricity, memory, and rules 😌⚡

```

## 🎯 Objectives for Day 1

- Understand the difference between analog and digital systems

- Learn how computers represent data using number systems

- Master binary, bits, bytes, and hexadecimal

- Understand computer hardware and the role of the CPU

- Learn how instructions are executed via the instruction cycle

- Understand memory hierarchy and why multiple memory types exist

- Learn how programs become machine instructions

- Understand why an operating system is required

- This is foundation-level knowledge. Everything else builds on this 🧱✨


## 🌍 Analog vs Digital (How Reality Becomes Bits)

### Analog (Real World 🌱)

- Continuous values

- Infinite variation

- Examples:

    - Temperature 🌡️

    - Sound waves 🎵

    - Light ☀️

- Represented using physical analogies:

    - Scale needle for weight

    - Mercury level for temperature

- Analog is expressive… but messy 😬
